# MoreMelody
Convert wav files into readable notes and play it back. Will implement a melody generator eventually.

Main is a first stable iteration that turns your recording into a wav file then outputs a list of tuples ('time', 'note')
MainCopy is an experimental version
  1. convert the list of tuples to sheet music
  2. generate melodies according to the sheet music

note: might create a new python project to figure out how to achieve task 2
